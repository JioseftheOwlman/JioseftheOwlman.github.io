## Overview


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SASS
- Box-Shadow Generator tool - Link: (https://cssgenerator.org/box-shadow-css-generator.html)


### What I learned

I learned a little more about positioning elements with CSS, this is the second time I have used SASS on something and I don't dislike the result at all

### Continued development

This is just the beginning, I still have many projects to do
